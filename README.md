# Session Saver plugin for SUBLIME 2 or 3


## Author: Jerry Liu

## Original Author: Guillermo Carrasco Hernandez

This plugin pretends to ease the session managment in sublime.

With this plugin you can save and restore your opened document sessions. So you don't need to keep different windows opened to work with different sessions any more.
